Just a quick demonstration of a hacked together Helm 3 Chart to deploy link:https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma[uptime-kuma] on OpenShift, but also on Kubernetes.

It will deploy a single Pod as part of a `StatefulSet`, you can configure persistence and optionally deploy a OpenShift *Route* or regular K8s *Ingress* alongside.


== Custom Image

I build a custom image with the intent to repackage _uptime-kuma_ in an Open Shift compatible way (i.e. to support and work properly with arbitrary UIDs).
It is used within this chat and its sources can be fund under the `container` folder within this repo or here:

[source,dockerfile]
----
include::./container/Containerfile[]
----

I published a prebuilt version of this to link:https://quay.io/repository/k3rnel-pan1c/uptime-kuma?tab=info[Quay.io] and reference that within the Chart, feel free to use that or build it yourself :wink:.

== Support

IMPORTANT: Please note that this is plainly an *UNOFFICIAL* way to install _uptime-kuma_. So please do not expect to get help and or support in the official _uptime-kuma_ issues or other forms of help sections!

This Helm Chart and the image where validated against Open Shift 4.x, yet they should work fine with regular Kubernetes.

I will try to keep this Chart and container image updated and operational, yet keep in mind this is more a PoC than anything production ready/oriented.
